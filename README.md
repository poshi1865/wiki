This is a small script I wrote to quickly get an idea about a particular word/thing/place/person that you don't know about.

How to run
Python is needed to run this script. 
Clone this project, go into the project folder and run:
```
python3 wiki.py "insert what you want to search for here without quotes"
```
or 
```
python wiki.py "insert what you want to search for here without quotes"
```
depending on which version of python you have.

You can also make this file an executable and copy it to your ~/bin folder by running the following commands:
```
chmod u+x wiki.py
cp wiki.py ~/bin/wiki
```

Now you can run this program as shown below: 
```
wiki "insert what you want to search for here without quotes"
```
